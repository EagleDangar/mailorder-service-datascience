What Is This?
-------------

This case study is based on real life project given by Bertelsmann/Arvato Financial Services located in Germany and Udacity as a capstone project of Data Science Nano Degree. This project is also about Unsupervised learning and customer segmentation. 

This project is divided in below mentioned three major parts :-

    1. Customer Segmentation :- Analyze the demographic data of the general population and the current customers using Unsupervised learning techniques.

    2. Supervised Learning Model :- Preprocess the given training data based on previous analysis done in customer segmentation part and train the machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

    3. Kaggle Competition :- Use trained machine learning model on given campaign data to do the predictions as a Kaggle competition.

## Conclusion

        This real life project provided by Mail-Order service, was to create the customer 
        segmentation using the general population of Germany. This analysis could be helpful for
        marketing team to target individuals who are more likely to be interested in their 
        Mail-Order service.
